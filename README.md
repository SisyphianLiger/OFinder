This is the Personal Project for Boot.dev

The goal is to make a nvim or VSc users life easier. 


The tool is a fuzzy finder that will find a selected project of file.
When you find the file, if it is not a directory, it will create your
root exit at the Directory level in your bash terminal, and you will 
also be able to choose to start from the file or directory with your 
IDE.
